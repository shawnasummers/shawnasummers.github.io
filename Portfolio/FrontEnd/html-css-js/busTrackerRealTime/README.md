#Project Title
##Real Time Bus Tracker Challenge

#Description
##The Real Time Bus Tracker uses Mapbox API to display the current location of MBTA buses in Boston, MA. 

#Installation
##To run this project download the files and open the index.html file via a browser or fork the busTrackerRealTime directory into your own directory for your github pages. You need to replace the Mapbox API key with your own Mapbox API key. 

#Roadmap
##I would like to add other API information to this map such as where ubers or taxis are located so riders can decide if they want to stay on the bus or catch a different ride.
