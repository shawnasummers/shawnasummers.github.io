# Description
The pacManHorizontalChomper project has an updated Ms. Pac-Man instead of Pac-Man moving horizontally opening and closing her mouth in an eating motion from one side of the screen to the next side of the screen.  

# Installation
To run this project download the files and open the index.html file via a browser or fork the Eyes directory into your own directory for your github pages. If you change the size of the window/screen you are using you will need to refresh the page to get Ms. Pac-Man to change to the new screen size.

# Roadmap
I would like to put dots infront of Ms. Pac-Man that disappear as see eats them and then a blue ghost that is running away from her in the same horizontal line.
